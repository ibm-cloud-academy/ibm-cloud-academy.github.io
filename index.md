# Lab environment
To do the lab exercises you can either use a remote lab environment provided or prepare your local environment to run the labs. See the following for details:
* [Remote lab environment](#remote-lab-environment)
* [Local lab environment](#local-lab-environment)

## Remote lab environment
To use the remote lab environment you need to check the following:
* [Network connectivity](#network-connectivity)

### Network connectivity
The lab exercises for this course are hosted on the Skytap cloud virtualization environment. Test your connection to the server with the following links:

1. Run the [connectivity test](https://cloud.skytap.com/connectivity) to confirm that your computer can connect to the IBM Lab environment.
2. Run the [speed test](http://speedtest.skytap.com/) to test the speed and latency of your connection to the Lab environment.

*Note:* To enable Adobe Flash support for the speed test, [follow these instructions](https://help.skytap.com/Speedtest.html#no-flash).

## Local lab environment
To run the lab exercises on your local environment you need to prepare it by following the appropriate link:
* [Preparation on Windows 10](set_up_windows10.md)
* [Preparation on MAC](set_up_mac.md)
* [Preparation on Linux](set_up_linux.md)
