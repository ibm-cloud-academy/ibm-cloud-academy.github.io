## Network connectivity
The lab exercises for this course are hosted on the Skytap cloud virtualization environment. Test your connection to the server with the following links:

1. Run the [connectivity test](https://cloud.skytap.com/connectivity) to confirm that your computer can connect to the IBM Lab environment.
2. Run the [speed test](http://speedtest.skytap.com/) to test the speed and latency of your connection to the Lab environment.

*Note:* To enable Adobe Flash support for the speed test, [follow these instructions](https://help.skytap.com/Speedtest.html#no-flash).
